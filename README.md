## Carbon Neutral Token

TerraCarbon is a platform for carbon credit buyers and sellers to interact in the most meaningful way towards a central goal of improving the planet. Carbon neutrality is a powerful goal to be conquered, overcome and something to be looked back on as a lesson. We will be doing so by creating a fungible token that we will be using as the currency for trade.

## Procedure

Create a jupyter notebook to identify users’ and their carbon emissions. (pandas, API)
Define our token specs: Name, symbol, total supply, and decimal places.. 
Write up a smart contract: Include basic functions of a ERC-20 token, such as transfer, approve, and balanceOf. 
Deploy the smart contract on Ethereum using Remix IDE.
Create a user interface: Create a user interface that will enable users to interact with the smart contract and trade carbon credits.(Using React)
Facilitate carbon credit trading: Create a decentralised exchange (DEX) on the blockchain. DEX can allow users to buy and sell carbon credits using your token.
Interact with our deployed smart contract to transfer and withdraw funds. 
Create a video demonstrating all of these steps.


## Why is this important? 

Using your own tokens for trading carbon credits can provide several advantages over traditional methods of trading. Here are some reasons why:

Lower Transaction Costs: By using your own tokens, you can avoid the transaction fees charged by third-party intermediaries such as banks or exchanges. This can significantly reduce the cost of trading and make it more accessible for smaller investors.
Faster Settlement: Traditional carbon credit trading can take several days to settle, while using tokens can enable near-instant settlement, making the process faster and more efficient.
Increased Transparency: Tokens are built on blockchain technology, which provides a tamper-proof ledger that can be easily audited. This can increase transparency in the trading process and help to prevent fraud.
Improved Liquidity: Tokens can be traded 24/7, which can increase liquidity and make it easier to buy and sell carbon credits.
More Accessible: By using tokens, carbon credit trading can become more accessible to a wider range of investors, including those in countries where traditional financial systems are not well-established.
It's important to note that using your own tokens for carbon credit trading may also have some disadvantages, such as the potential for price volatility and the need to ensure that the tokens comply with regulatory requirements. However, with proper planning and execution, using tokens can be a viable option for carbon credit trading.



## ELON INTRODUCTION SCRIPT

Hello FinTech Students,

Carbon credits are a fascinating concept that have the potential to help us reduce our carbon footprint and slow down climate change. In simple terms, carbon credits are like a currency that companies can use to offset their carbon emissions. 

Now, some people may argue that carbon credits are just a way for companies to continue emitting greenhouse gases without actually reducing their emissions. And to some extent, they're right. Carbon credits are not a silver bullet solution to climate change, but they can play a role in incentivizing companies to invest in sustainable practices and technologies.
At Tesla, we've always been committed to reducing our carbon footprint, which is why we focus on developing and producing electric vehicles and renewable energy products that can help decarbonize the transportation and energy sectors.

The ultimate goal should be a zero-emissions economy where carbon credits are no longer needed. And that's what we're working towards at Tesla, SpaceX and The Boring Company. We believe that we can make a significant impact on reducing emissions by developing and scaling sustainable technologies, and we hope that others will join us in this effort.

Carbon credits can be a useful tool in the fight against climate change, but they're not the full solution. We need to keep pushing for innovative and sustainable solutions on our way to a zero-emissions future.

Now, I’d like to pass it over to my good friends, Norman, Jenn, Rei, Moh and Sujatha to talk more about Carbon Credits and the Smart Contract system they’ve created…








# BACKGROUND
Beginning our project, we wanted to provide some background information on why Carbon Credits are something to be knowledgable about.  We started by using Python to create some graphs on emissions and the population world-wide as well as by country.

The resulting graphs show the increasing population and emissions throughout the world.  

Using this graph, we can review the population increases in every country in the world since 1800.  We used the groupby function to make the graph customizable in the file.

Using this graph, we can review the total GHG increases in every country in the world since 1990.  We used the groupby function to make the graph customizable in the file.

To zoom in on certain countries that are the major contributors to greenhouse emisisons, we looked at the top 30 countires in 1990 and again in 2019.

You can also reveiw the total World Population and the World GHG Emissions by reviewing the next couple graphs.

While reseaching the graphs, we used another hvplot function that we did not review in class.  By using the "hvplot.explorer" function, we can take the entire DataFrame and easily review and customize what we would like to see.  This allows you to customize all inputs to the graphs and quickly change the inputs and chart types.
